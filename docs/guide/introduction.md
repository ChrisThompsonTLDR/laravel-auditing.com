# Introduction

If you're a Laravel developer looking to maintain strict control over the data in your application, the Laravel Auditing package could be just what you need. This powerful tool offers detailed auditing capabilities for Eloquent models, allowing you to keep track of changes made to records, as well as any changes to their attributes. By providing information about discrepancies and anomalies that could indicate business concerns or suspect activities, this package can help you detect potential issues and ensure that your application is running smoothly and securely.

One of the best things about the Laravel Auditing package is that it's easy to use. Simply use a trait to keep a history of model changes, and you can retrieve the audited data in a straightforward manner, making it possible to display it in various ways. This feature makes it easy to customize and control the auditing process, and to access metadata and modified data in different ways.
